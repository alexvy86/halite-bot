Need to test with less random movement within our territory. So much movement doesn't allow for strength build-up.

At some point need to test with "difussion parameters" that dictate the behavior of all pieces.
These could be calculated from total strength/production/territory for each player.

Alternatively, give each piece a role and have it stick to it during its lifetime. What to do when pieces merge, though?

Strategy to try: detect the highest-production-lowest-strength block in the perimeter and send all resources there. Maybe split by
cardinal direction.

Once you have the whole screen width or height, all movement should be directed to the other orientation.

Try: calculate "choke points" (best no-man-land to conquer in the perimeter, battle sites with enemies in the perimeter) and start
from there to calculate the moves.

Once there is a whole vertical wall, sometimes squares get stupid and start moving perpendicularly to that wall because of the interactions
between the perimeter squares and the nearby ones.

Try an approach where we calculate a heuristic for each square in the map, and then we just iterate over each of our squares telling it
to move to the square with the best heuristic it can find among its neighbors. Probably needs calculating the heuristic based on current
square in addition to neighbors.
